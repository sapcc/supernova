This project is outdated and no longer maintained. You can find the new version in the [new project](https://github.com/cloudoperators/greenhouse-extensions/tree/main/alerts/ui.)


Supernova is an alternative UI for Prometheus Alertmanager with some quality of life improvements:


* Predefined filter categories
* Easy filtering
* Aggregation and counting of alerts by region and severity
* Different display modes for desktop or dashboard view
* Automatic URL linking for URLs in descriptions
* Parsing of alert labels for included external links
* Mobile-friendly UI

It also has integrations with PagerDuty, displaying PagerDuty status for relevant alerts and offering a way to acknowledge alerts in PagerDuty from Supernova.
